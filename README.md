### Our aim is to create a website that:
 - Introduce newcomers to 'coding for everyone'. I.e. the principles and concept.
 - Advise users on the timetabling for the weekly meetups, or at least link users to the meetup.com page.
 - Coordinate the already available resources, i.e. point people in the direction of the github and gitter groups to help people integrate.
 - Provide beginners with useful resources for starting their venture into coding.
