# CodingForEveryone Website Repo

### Our aim is to create a website that:
 - Introduce newcomers to 'coding for everyone'. I.e. the principles and concept.
 - Advise users on the timetabling for the weekly meetups, or at least link users to the meetup.com page.
 - Coordinate the already available resources, i.e. point people in the direction of the github and gitter groups to help people integrate.
 - Provide beginners with useful resources for starting their venture into coding.

###  Website Tree (this will change):

```
|-- Home
|-- About
|-- Schedule
|-- Resources
|-- Contact
```

### To View Site:

1) Clone repo to your local directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/codingforeveryone/codingforeveryone.github.io.git
```
2) Open the index.html file in your browser of choice

### If anyone has any recommendations for the project, please do voice them in the gitter room :)
