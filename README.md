# CodingForEveryone Website Repo

#### Our aim is to create a website that:
 - Introduce newcomers to 'coding for everyone'. I.e. the principles and concept.
 - Advise users on the timetabling for the weekly meetups, or at least link users to the meetup.com page.
 - Coordinate the already available resources, i.e. point people in the direction of the github and gitter groups to help people integrate.
 - Provide beginners with useful resources for starting their venture into coding.

####  Website Tree (this will change):

```
|-- Home
|-- About
|-- Schedule
|-- Resources
|-- Contact
```

If anyone has any recommendations for the project, please do voice them in this gitter room :):
