View the 'concept' site [here](http://codingforeveryone.github.io/site/).

## What

This repo hosts the Coding for Everyone website.

Coding for Everyone is a community for those learning to code. Participants can interact though the [Monday meetups](http://meetups.com/founderscoders/) and/or the [gitter community](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone/).

## Why

 - Introduce newcomers to 'coding for everyone'. I.e. the principles and concept.
 - Advise users on the timetabling for the weekly meetups, or at least link users to the meetup.com page.
 - Coordinate the already available resources, i.e. point people in the direction of the github and gitter groups to help people integrate.
 - Provide beginners with useful resources for starting their venture into coding.


## How

Currently the ['concept' site](http://codingforeveryone.github.io/site/) is written using the bootstrap framework and jquery library. The final site will be written using the following:

- HTML
- CSS (written using SASS)
- Vanilla javascript
- Jekyll
